## Project Overview

**WebShop.com** is a learning / portfolio project demonstrating:

- A static product showcase
- Add‑to‑cart behavior persisted in `localStorage`
- A contact form that stores submissions in MongoDB
- A review system 
- A protected admin dashboard to manage contact submissions 
- Responsive UI with progressive enhancements

The project is intentionally minimal with no complex checkout or payments, so the focus is on full‑stack fundamentals and clean structure.
